What is ChatGPT?
====================================================

ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) language model that was developed by OpenAI. It utilizes deep learning algorithms to generate natural language responses to user queries. In the energy industry, ChatGPT is being increasingly used in chatbots to provide energy analytics and optimization services.

How does ChatGPT work?
----------------------

ChatGPT is based on the Transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for processing large amounts of text data. The model consists of layers of self-attention mechanisms that allow it to learn from the relationships between words and phrases in a given text.

During training, ChatGPT is exposed to massive amounts of text data, including books, articles, and websites. This allows it to develop a deep understanding of language patterns and to generate highly accurate and relevant responses to user queries.

What are the features of ChatGPT?
